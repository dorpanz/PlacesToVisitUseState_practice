    title: "CN Tower",
    description: "Toronto’s most iconic landmark is the 1,815-foot CN Tower, the tallest freestanding structure in the world from 1976, when it was built, to 2007. While the tower does serve a purpose—its 335-foot antenna is used to broadcast television, radio, and cell signals—it’s also the most popular attraction in the city. The concrete megastructure is home to a number of observation decks, a restaurant with the highest wine cellar in the world (at 1,151 feet), and the EdgeWalk, a thrilling attraction that lets visitors walk outside the structure at 1,168 feet above street level. Tickets are required, with different packages providing different experiences.",

    description: "Kensington Market is not actually a market, but a food-centric neighborhood in downtown Toronto. While the city at large is known for its diverse population, there’s perhaps no better place to witness that multiculturalism in such a concentrated area than here. Whatever type of food you’re in the mood for, from Ethiopian to Vietnamese to Jamaican, there’s probably a restaurant, grocery store, or hole-in-the-wall for it. Some favorites include Seven Lives Tacos Y Mariscos for stellar tacos and NU Bügel for Montreal-style bagels with Venezuelan toppings. Beyond all the food, there are also vintage shops, independent boutiques, and artists’ studios tucked into Victorian-style houses all throughout the neighborhood.",

    description: "The Toronto Islands, located just offshore from downtown Toronto, are an 820-acre car-free haven. While 600 people live on the islands, the majority of visitors are day-trippers who come to enjoy the beaches, parks, gardens, yacht clubs, cafés, and a small amusement park for children. Seasonal activities include kayaking, picnicking, barbecuing, and outdoor yoga classes.",

    description: "Explore the Waters of the World at Ripley's Aquarium of Canada. Located in the heart of downtown Toronto at the base of the CN Tower, the aquarium is Toronto's must-see attraction for tourists and locals of all ages. Immerse yourself in a world of 20,000 aquatic animals and discover your own underwater adventure. The Aquarium features North America’s longest underwater viewing tunnel with more than 5.7 million litres of water and over 100 interactive opportunities. Get up close and personal with several touch exhibits featuring horseshoe crabs, sharks, scarlet cleaner shrimp, and stingrays as well as daily dive shows every 2 hours. This awe-inspiring attraction consists of nine carefully curated galleries showcasing a cross section of saltwater and freshwater environments from around the world – starting with species from Toronto’s backyard, the Great Lakes basin.",

Of particular note are its collections of Canadian and Indigenous art, though it also has notable works by European masters like Rembrandt, Auguste Rodin, and Pablo Picasso. The museum underwent a $276 million renovation by Toronto-born architect Frank Gehry in 2008, his first work in his native city, doubling its exhibition space.",

    description: `If you’re looking for a one-stop shop of a museum, the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) is your best bet. Originally established in 1912 as collection of five museums dedicated to archaeology, paleontology, mineralogy, zoology, and geology, ROM has since consolidated its efforts, covering everything from natural and cultural history to fine arts and design within the same massive space. It’s not often you can find dinosaur bones and fashion exhibitions within the same space. Be sure to spend a few minutes lingering outside the Queen's Park entrance, too, to best appreciate starchitect Daniel Libeskind's geometric marvel of a structure, dubbed the "Michael Lee-Chin Crystal," part of a multi-million dollar expansion to the museum, unveiled in 2007.`,

Strolling through the neighborhood’s brick-paved pedestrian streets, visitors might feel as if they’ve been transported to Victorian-era Canada—the craftspeople who restored the old structures kept true to the original construction materials as much as possible. And while there are still breweries and distilleries here (including the Spirit of York Distillery and the Mill St. Brew Pub), there are also restaurants, local-owned boutiques, and art galleries.",

    description: "Canada might not be known for its castles, but Toronto is home to an unusual one that has become a beloved tourist attraction. Casa Loma is a 98-room château built by Canadian businessman Sir Henry Mill Pellatt in 1914, who went bankrupt shortly after completing his beloved home. Casa Loma now serves as a museum and a popular filming location, most notably serving as Professor Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngers in X-Men. Do the self-guided tour, which you can fly through at a clip, providing the place isn't packed; it can be tricky to rush past the crowds during busier times, especially in some of the smaller spaces, tunnels, and towers. Must-sees include secret passageways, gardens, and an underground pool.",

The zoo is divided into seven zoogeographic regions: Indo-Malaya, Africa, Americas, Tundra Trek, Australasia, Eurasia, and the Canadian Domain. Some animals are displayed indoors in pavilions and outdoors in what would be their naturalistic environments, with viewing at many levels. The zoo also has areas such as the Kids Zoo, Waterside Theatre, and Splash Island. The zoo has one of the most taxonomically diverse collection of animals on display of any zoo worldwide and is currently home to over 3,000 animals (including invertebrates and fish) representing over 300 species.

Dedicated entirely to the history of ice hockey in Canada, the Hockey Hall of Fame holds regular exhibits on famous players and teams, and displays permanent galleries of National Hockey League (NHL) records, trophies and miscellaneous memorabilia.

It now resides in the historic Bank of Montreal building in downtown Toronto. The Hockey Hall of Fame is spread over 65,000 sq ft and offers a slew of activities, including hockey simulation games, as well as an expansive retail store dedicated to hockey equipment and merchandise.",
